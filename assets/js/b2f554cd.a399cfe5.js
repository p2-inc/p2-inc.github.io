Furthermore, they are keenly aware of the weaknesses in their personal \\"attack surface\\", and search for ways to balance convenience with risk.\\n\\nBut you are here because you want to find a way to implement magic links quickly. First, some background.\\n\\n### What are magic links?\\n\\nMagic links are a type of password-less authentication that allow your users to log in to your application following a link that is emailed to them, rather than typing a username and password. Magic links can also be used as a part of a multi-factor authentication (MFA) strategy.\\n\\nIn a magic link flow, the application\'s authentication provider asks users for an email address rather than a password. The authentication provider generates a link with an embedded token, and sends to the user\'s email. There may be some other steps taken by the provider, such as verifying the provided email address matches an existing user. The user then opens the email, clicks the link, is verified by the authentication provider, and is granted access to the application\\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-flow.png)\\n\\n### Pros and cons\\n\\nLike any mechanism that tries to streamline a security process such as authentication, there are both pros and cons to the magic link approach. First in the plus column:\\n\\n- Enhances user experience, which makes users more likely to use your application, and be satisfied with the experience. This drives user engagement.\\n- User onboarding is accelerated, as magic links can be sent to new users as well as existing ones. Registration for your application is as easy as entering your email address.\\n- You\'ll never have a password breach. When there are no passwords, there are no password breaches. A huge number of corporate data breaches are due to insufficient and compromised passwords.\\n- No more customer support requests related to lost passwords. Over half of customer support requests are due to authentication problems, many of those are users unable to remember their passwords. This eliminates a huge portion of those.\\n\\nNothing is perfect, and there are also several potential downsides to magic links:\\n\\n- Account security and access are now tied to the security of the user\'s email account. If the user\'s computer or other device is compromised, and attacker could potentially obtain the link and impersonate the user.\\n- If the user or email provider does not enforce encrypted network access to email, it may be possible for an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack where they can obtain the link by observing network traffic.\\n- Ability to access your application is now tied to email deliverability. If your email service or the user\'s email provider fails to deliver the email containing the link in a timely fashion, it could deteriorate the experience for the user.\\n\\n### Limiting risk\\n\\nFortunately, there are things your application and the user can do in order to limit some of the possible downside risks of using magic links. Your application can:\\n\\n- Make the magic links single use, or set a very short expiration time for the links.\\n- Enforce an additional factor when using magic links.\\n\\nYour user can:\\n\\n- Choose an email provider that enforces the use of encrypted connections.\\n- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to further protect their email accounts.\\n\\n### Setup guide\\n\\nSorry for the wait! We wanted to give you an overview of magic links before diving into how to set them up with Phase Two. \\n\\nIf you haven\'t already, get an account on [Phase Two](https://phasetwo.io/dashboard). You\'ll notice that we use magic links in addition to social login options. As we said above, we\'re trying to make it as frictionless as possible to get in and start using the product.\\n\\nOnce you log in and create your first deployment, open the Phase Two enhanced Keycloak console. In order to email links to your users, you\'ll need to set up email. If you haven\'t already done that, head over to our [email setup guide](/blog/2022-10-05-set-up-email.md). \\n\\nAfter you\'ve completed email setup, select the **Authentication** menu item, and then select the **Magic link** flow from the list.\\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-magiclinkauth.png)\\n\\nOpen the configuration for the **Magic Link Authenticator** by clicking the gear icon on the last line with the **Magic Link** execution. You\'ll notice two options:\\n- **Force create user** creates a new user when an email is provided that does not match an existing user. This allows the use of magic links to register new users that have not been previously seen.\\n- **Update profile on create** adds an UPDATE_PROFILE required action if the user was created. This means that the user will need to fill out other required fields such as first/last name, etc. \\n\\nFor the purpose of our demonstration, let\'s set **Force create user** to ON and **Update profile on create** to OFF (remember, low friction). Save the configuration, and go back to the flow page.\\n\\nIn the **Action** menu of the flow page, select **Bind**, and select **Browser flow**.\\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-bind.png)\\n\\nNow you\'re ready to test it out. If you don\'t have an application that is setup and protected by Keycloak, you can use the built-in account console to try it out. Navigate to the **Clients** menu, and open the link next to the **account** client in an incognito window (this will prevent conflict, as you are already logged in to the admin console as the administrator). \\n\\nClick **Sign In** and you\'ll be redirected to the authentication page. Enter your email address, and you\'ll be sent a magic link. Click on the link in your email, and you\'ll see your details in the account console. \\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-login.png)\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-confirm.png)\\n\\nGo back to the admin console in the other browser window, and navigate to the **Users** section. You will be able to find the user that was just created.\\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-admin-user.png)\\n\\nMagic links are a great way to streamline your user onboarding and experience to help you easily drive engagement across your application. Phase Two makes it quick and easy to integrate magic links (and social login, and enterprise SSO, and much more). Stay tuned for more guides that will help you build the authentication experience that is right for your app."},{"id":"set-up-email","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/set-up-email","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-05-set-up-email.md","title":"Set Up Email in Phase Two","description":"One of the first things you will need to do when getting a Keycloak Realm ready for use is to set up your email server configuration.

We\'ve received a lot of requests from customers to implement \\"magic link\\" login functionality that would allow users to login to an application using a link sent to their email or over some other secure channel. \\n\\nTo that end, we\'ve implemented two pathways for creating a magic link. One can be configured in the Authentication section of the admin UI by duplicating the Browser flow, and replacing the normal Username/Password/OTP forms with the Magic Link execution type\\n![Install Magic Link Authenticator in Browser Flow](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-magic-link/raw/main/docs/assets/magic-authenticator.png)\\nThis mechanism inserts a authenticator in the login flow that intercepts the email address and sends the magic link in an email to to the user.\\n\\nWe\'ve also implemented a web service that allows you to create a magic link without necessarily sending an email. This will allow you to send the link through another channel.

Integrating tools like this can be a large effort, and can be difficult to unwind if the terms or service fall short. While our adoption of standards such as OpenID and SAML allayed some of those fears, we wanted to go a step further.\\n\\nWe built the initial verison of Phase Two as a set of extensions to the [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) Open Source Identity and Access Management system, built and maintained by Red Hat. After several months of developing for it, and operating it for our customers, we\'ve decided to continue using it. Keycloak has been battle-tested and hardened for over 6 years. It\'s security and reliability is depended on by organizations from small startups to Fortune 500 companies and governments.\\n\\nTo put to rest any future concerns about vendor lock-in, we\'re committing to making our core extensions to Keycloak open source. While we will endeavor to make Phase Two simple to use, operate and scale, we will maintain compatibility so that customers can migrate to their own Keycloak deployment. Updates and links to our open source extensions will be published in the [Open Source](/docs/introduction/open-source) section of the documentation, and will be available in our [p2-inc GitHub organization page](https://github.com/p2-inc).\\n\\nWe have benefitted immensely from the open source communitiy, and we are excited to give back!"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2020-09-28-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to Phase Two","description":"After building and working for startups and technology companies for almost 25 years, I found myself having a sense of d\xe9j\xe0-vu.","date":"2020-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 28, 2020","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"phase_two","permalink":"/blog/tags/phase-two"}],"readingTime":2.1,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Phase Two"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome to Phase Two","author":"Phase Two","tags":["release","phase_two"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Keycloak, and Our Commitment to Open Source","permalink":"/blog/keycloak"}},"content":"After building and working for startups and technology companies for almost 25 years, I found myself having a sense of d\xe9j\xe0-vu. \\n\\nHad I really built the same features and functionality over and over?\\n\\nEveryone of us who has been in the industry for any length of time probably has the same feeling. Whether or not we are fully conscious of it, we probably built a (bad) version of login, registration, user management, authorization, organizations and invitations, audit logging, etc. at least one time for every company we\'ve worked for. \\n\\nIn early 2018, I joined an enterprise SaaS startup, where I built the initial team and product over 18 months. Analyzing tickets and epics in the project tracking system we used, I found that over 60% of our first 18 months was spent building features and functionality like this -- essential building blocks, but not the core competency we sought to test in the marketplace. And the result of that effort was only adequate versions of those common features, which resulted in less time spent on what we were trying to prove. I began to refer to this heavy tax a \\"SaaS CRUD\\".\\n\\nWas this really what everyone else was doing? I was lucky to have a large network of engineering leaders at companies that ranged from the earliest stages to the largest public companies, so I asked them. The responses were remarkably consisitent. Early stage companies wished there was something comprehensive they could adopt, and later stage and large companies lamented not adopting external tools earlier that gave them guarantees around uptime and compliance. All were aware of or had tried to knit together a mish-mash of \\"feature company\\" products, and all expressed dissatisfaction with \\"model mismatch\\" of most of the tools in the marketplace, which demanded more integration overhead than the perceived benefit allowed. \\n\\nI was lucky to find others that had observed the same thing. We joined forces and spent the next 6 months interviewing companies of a range of sizes, developing a playbook for companies building new products. Based on that playbook, today we are releasing our first version of tooling designed to help application developers avoid rebuilding \\"SaaS CRUD\\".\\n\\nPhase Two is designed to help SaaS companies accelerate time-to-market. Authentication and SSO are our first targets, but we plan to expand to many other areas of pain for the growing company seeking enterprise adoption. We\'d love for you to join us on this journey.
