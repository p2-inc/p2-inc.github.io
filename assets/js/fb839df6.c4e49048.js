By utilizing Keycloak, these applications can streamline the user login experience through various protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, which Keycloak natively supports. With Keycloak, mobile applications can handle user sign-in, token management, and session handling securely, ensuring user identities are managed consistently across devices and platforms. This setup enables native applications to offload the complexities of authentication to Keycloak, allowing seamless integrations with features like Single Sign-On (SSO), social logins, and multi-factor authentication, while developers can focus on app functionality rather than handling sensitive user data directly.
