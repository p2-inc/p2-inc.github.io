This allows each tenant to have individualized data, configurations, and sometimes even unique customizations, while benefiting from a shared platform that reduces overall resource demands and maintenance. Multi-tenancy is commonly used in SaaS (Software as a Service) applications, enabling businesses to scale efficiently, lower costs, and streamline updates while ensuring that each tenant\u2019s data and settings remain private and distinct from others within the same application. This approach is particularly valuable in enterprise applications, where companies may need to provide access to different organizations, departments, or customer groups within a single solution."})]})}function p(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},28453:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>r});var n=a(96540);const i={},o=n.createContext(i);function s(e){const t=n.useContext(o);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:s(e.components),n.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}},8732:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/blog/multi-tenancy-with-keycloak-organizations","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-11-multi-tenancy-with-organizations.md","title":"Implement Multi-Tenancy Applications with Keycloak Organizations","description":"Applications needing to leverage Keycloak to consolidate logins can leverage Keycloak Organizations.","date":"2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"keycloak","permalink":"/blog/tags/keycloak"},{"inline":true,"label":"phase_two","permalink":"/blog/tags/phase-two"},{"inline":true,"label":"organizations","permalink":"/blog/tags/organizations"},{"inline":true,"label":"multitenant","permalink":"/blog/tags/multitenant"}],"readingTime":5.37,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Phase Two","title":"Hosted Keycloak and Keycloak Support","url":"https://github.com/p2-inc","email":"support@phasetwo.io","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60152109?s=200&v=4","key":"phasetwo","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"multi-tenancy-with-keycloak-organizations","title":"Implement Multi-Tenancy Applications with Keycloak Organizations","description":"Applications needing to leverage Keycloak to consolidate logins can leverage Keycloak Organizations.","authors":"phasetwo","tags":["keycloak","phase_two","organizations","multitenant"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why your startup should use Keycloak for SSO and User Management - Part 4: Cost","permalink":"/blog/keycloak-for-startups-cost"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why your startup should use Keycloak for SSO and User Management - Part 3: Customization","permalink":"/blog/keycloak-for-startups-customization"}}')}}]);
