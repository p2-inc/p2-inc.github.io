We also have a plain [React example](https://phasetwo.io/blog/https://phasetwo.io/blog/instant-user-managemenet-and-sso-for-reactjs).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Setting up a Keycloak Instance\\n\\n<PhaseTwoStarterInstructions />\\n\\n## Setting up an OIDC Client\\n\\n<OIDC />\\n\\n## Adding a Non-Admin User\\n\\n<NonAdminUser />\\n\\n## Setting up a Next.js Project\\n\\n:::info\\nWe will use the Phase Two Next.js example code here, but the logic could easily be applied to any existing application.\\n:::\\n\\nThis example uses Next.js 13 and splits `server` and `client` components accordingly.\\n\\n1. Clone the Phase Two [example repo](https://github.com/p2-inc/examples/).\\n1. Open the Next.js [folder](https://github.com/p2-inc/examples/tree/main/frameworks/nextjs) within `/frameworks/nextjs`.\\n1. Run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. This example leverages [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) to provide hook and HOC support.\\n1. NextAuth.js configures an API route that is uses for the Authentication of the Client. It generates the routes automatically for you. These are added to Next.js in the `api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` file.\\n1. Open the `src/lib/auth.ts` file. This is a server only file. We will be updating a few values from the prior section where we set up our OIDC client. Taking the values from the OIDC Client Config section, set those values in the code. While it is recommended to use Environment variables for the secret, for the purpose of this tutorial, paste in the **Client secret** from the OIDC client creation section for the value of `clientSecret`\\n\\n   ```js\\n   const authServerUrl = \\"https://euc1.auth.ac/auth/\\";\\n   const realm = \\"shared-deployment-001\\";\\n   const clientId = \\"reg-example-1\\";\\n   const clientSecret = \\"CLIENT_SECRET\\"; // Paste \\"Client secret\\" here. Use Environment variables in prod\\n   ```\\n\\n   Those are used to popluate the `AuthOptions` config for the `KeycloakProvider`:\\n\\n   ```js\\n   export const AuthOptions: NextAuthOptions = {\\n     providers: [\\n       KeycloakProvider({\\n         clientId,\\n         clientSecret,\\n         issuer: `${authServerUrl}realms/${realm}`,\\n       }),\\n     ],\\n   };\\n   ```\\n\\n   The config is then provided to the `AuthProvider` in the `/src/app/layout.tsx` file. Next.js uses this file to generate an HTML view for this page.\\n\\n   ```js\\n   import { NextAuthProvider as AuthProvider } from \\"./providers\\";\\n   ...\\n   <AuthProvider {...oidcConfig}>\\n     <App />\\n   </AuthProvider>\\n   ```\\n\\n   At this point our entire application will be able to access all information and methods needed to perform authentication. View the `providers.tsx` file for additional information about how the `SessionProvider` is used. The `SessionProvider` enables use of Hooks to derive the authenticated state. View `user.component.tsx` for exactly how the code is authenticating your user. The sections rendering the \\"Log in\\" and \\"Log out\\" buttons are conditional areas based on the authenticated context. The buttons invoke functions provided by NextAuth.\\n\\n   The logic using the hook to conditionally determine the Authenticated state, can be used to secure routes, components, and more.\\n\\n1. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will see the Phase Two example landing page. You current state should be \\"Not authenticated\\". Click **Log In**. This will redirect you to your login page.\\n\\n   :::info\\n   Use the non-admin user created in the previous section to sign in.\\n   :::\\n\\n1. Enter the credentials of the non-admin user you created. Click **Submit**. You will then be redirected to the application. The Phase Two example landing page now loads your \\"Authenticated\\" state, displaying your user\'s email and their Token.\\n1. After your first log in, click **Log out**. Then click **Log in** again. Notice how this time you will not be redirected to sign in as your state is already in the browser. Neat! If you clear the browser state for that tab, then you will have to be redirected away to sign-in again.\\n\\n## Learning more\\n\\nPhase Two\'s enhanced Keycloak provides many ways to quickly control and tweak the log in and user management experience.

Our Phase Two enhanced Keycloak distribution is now available as a hosted, dedicated cluster in the region of your choice.\\n\\nAbout 9 months ago, we launched our self-service, shared deployments, offering customers the ability to [create](https://phasetwo.io/dashboard/) Phase Two enhanced Keycloak realms on our shared clusters. Over that period, we\'ve provided over 700 free realms for testing and small production use cases. Many of you have reached out to us asking about an SLA, isolated resources, and ability to grow into larger use cases. Based on your requests and feedback, we built out our dedicated cluster offering.\\n\\n### What is Phase Two again?\\n\\nPhase Two helps SaaS builders accelerate time-to-market and enterprise adoption with powerful SSO, identity and user management features. To that end, Phase Two has created an enhanced distribution of [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) that bundles several essential [open source extensions](https://github.com/p2-inc) for modern SaaS use cases. We support hosted and on-prem customers for a variety of use cases.\\n\\n### Why dedicated?\\n\\nDedicated clusters allow us to provide compute, network and storage isolation for customer workloads, and to easily deploy in the region where customer\'s users are. With dedicated clusters, we can guarantee an [SLA](/docs/sla) that meets customer\'s needs with no resource contention from other customers.\\n\\nFurthermore, it allows us to support customer-provided domain names, and access to monitoring and management capabilities not available in the shared clusters.\\n\\n### How did you do it?\\n\\nWe built out our dedicated cluster offering using the best-of-breed open source tools and managed services.\\n\\nThe core consists of Kubernetes clusters in each [supported AWS and GCP region](/docs/self-service/dedicated-clusters#regions). New dedicated clusters are provisioned instantly using FluxCD, a continuous delivery solution that gives us the history and auditability of git. Monitoring and alerting is done using Prometheus, Grafana, and a suite of external services that give us a complete view of cluster health.\\n\\nThe database tier uses a managed CockroachDB service provided by [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/). Phase Two is the only provider that is capable of hosting the current Keycloak distribution (the \\"legacy\\" store) using CockroachDB. Working with Cockroach Labs gives us the expertise and reliability from hosting thousands of customer clusters at massive scale. \\n\\n### Take me to it!\\n\\nStarting today, you\'ll be able to [log into the updated dashboard](https://phasetwo.io/dashboard), and create your dedicated cluster by selecting a region and setting up your billing information.\\n\\n![](/docs/dedicated-clusters-create.png)\\n\\nFollowing successful billing setup, you will be returned to the Dashboard while your Cluster is provisioned. Once provisioned, you\'ll be able to create up to 20 realms per cluster, using the same easy setup as you are used to in the shared deployment offering.\\n\\n![](/docs/dedicated-clusters-pending.png)\\n\\nMost clusters will be provisioned within 30 minutes, but some requests may take up to 24 hours. Additionally, for payment types such as ACH or SEPA, cluster provisioning will begin following payment clearing (up to 4 days in some cases).\\n\\n### How much does it cost?\\n\\n[Plans](/#pricing) start at $499US per month when paid annually. This provides a set of compute, network and storage resources that have been tested for common use cases for up to 20 realms and 1 million users. If your use case is uncommon or you plan to scale beyond that, our system is designed to scale up with your needs. Our plans scale linearly with resource demands beyond our minimums.\\n\\nWe will continue to support a robust Free tier. \\n\\n### What\'s next? (psst... Global clusters)\\n\\nMany of our on-prem, suppport customers with large use cases asked us to build out a solution for massive-scale, fault-tolerant, multi-region use cases. One of the great parts of building support for Keycloak\'s existing storage system for CockroacDB is that we\'ve been able to explore use cases that were previously impossible using the standard Keycloak distribution, or required complex, error-prone configurations. For use cases with these requirements, plus global proximity to users and regional failover, we built global clusters, backed by CockroachDB multi-region database, for which we are now in *beta*.\\n\\nThese clusters provide a minimum of 3 global regions, with 3 instances of Phase Two enhanced Keycloak per region. Global server load balancing provides geographic region affinity and failover to connect your users with the closest, available instances.\\n\\nThere will be two price tiers for global clusters, depending on your use of our shared CockroachDB clusters, or your own dedicated clusters. We expect to launch general availability of global clusters later in Q3 2023.\\n\\nPlease contact [sales@phasetwo.io](mailto:sales@phasetwo.io) to talk to us about your global cluster use case."},{"id":"customizing-login-pages","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/customizing-login-pages","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-21-customizing-login-pages.md","title":"How To Customize Login Pages","description":"Brand is important to modern SaaS companies, and nowhere is that more apparent than at the front door: the login experience.

This eliminates the need to package and deploy a custom theme, and allows fast iteration without restart.\\n\\n## Simple customization\\n\\nIf you\'re in a hurry, logo and color customization can be achieved by adding your logo\'s URL and three color choices. These are available in the *General* and *Login* tabs of the **Styles** section.\\n\\n![](/blog/2023-04-21-styles-general.png)\\n\\n![](/blog/2023-04-21-styles-login.png)\\n\\nIn order for these setting to take effect, your **Realm Settings** *Themes* must also be set to `Attributes` for the *Login theme* type\\n\\n![](/blog/2023-04-21-theme-attributes.png)\\n\\n## Full customization using CSS\\n\\nMany of you will have more stringent branding requirements. For this, you can override the styles of the default Keycloak login theme. To discover the base styles that are available using this theme, we recommend\\n\\nNote that using CSS overrides will cause the colors from simple customization not to work.\\n\\nIn order to load your CSS, paste it into the \\"CSS\\" field in the *Login* tab of the **Styles** section.\\n\\n![](/blog/2023-04-21-styles-css.png)\\n\\nThis CSS will be the last CSS loaded, overridding the styles in the default `keycloak` login theme. \\n\\nReferences:\\n- [Keycloak login CSS](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/themes/src/main/resources/theme/keycloak/login/resources/css/login.css) - The default CSS for the `keycloak` login theme.\\n- [Patternfly 4](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/) - The styling library used by the theme.\\n\\n### CSS Examples\\n\\nTo get you started with some ideas, we\'ve created 3 example login themes that were done by overridding the CSS. These are free of license restriction, so feel free to download, use and customize the CSS at the links with the example images.\\n\\n* Consumer - [CSS](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-themes/blob/main/examples/consumer/login.css)\\n![](/blog/2023-04-21-consumer-theme.png)\\n\\n* Enterprise - [CSS](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-themes/blob/main/examples/enterprise/login.css)\\n![](/blog/2023-04-21-enterprise-theme.png)\\n\\n* SaaS - [CSS](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-themes/blob/main/examples/saas/login.css)\\n![](/blog/2023-04-21-saas-theme.png)\\n\\n#### Images and other assets\\n\\nYou\'ll notice that images, icons and fonts not found in the standard Keycloak themes are used. These are referenced by URL in the CSS. For example, if you are used to loading a custom font in the `<head>` of your HTML, it is possible to do it in CSS using `@import`:\\n\\n```css\\n@import url(\\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700&family=Lexend+Deca:wght@300;400;500;600;700&family=Lexend:wght@300;400;500;600;700&family=Work+Sans:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap\\");\\n```\\n\\nAnd background and other images can be referenced by their full URL using `url(...)`:\\n\\n```css\\n.login-pf body {\\n  background-image: url(\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2-inc/keycloak-themes/main/examples/saas/assets/SaaS%20BG.webp\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Success!\\n\\nAs always, our success is based on the success of our customers. We hope this extension and guide has helped you update the default Keycloak login branding to match that of your needs.

For this purpose, we\u2019ve got a debugging application on Github you can use to quickly see how a front end application is secured and what data is shared between Phase Two and the application.\\n- Clone our [debug-app](https://github.com/p2-inc/debug-app) from github, and open up the `frontend` folder in your favorite editor or IDE.\\n- Go back to the admin console and navigate to the **Clients** tab. Create a new client. Let\u2019s call it `frontend`. This will be a public OIDC client, with localhost:3001 as the root and redirect uri.\\n- Get the `keycloak.json` from the configuration and copy it. Paste it into `keycloak.json` to configure your `debug-app`.\\n\\nBefore we continue, we need to configure an authentication flow that does our SSO redirect.\\n- Navigate to the **Authentication** tab, and duplicate the **Browser** flow. \\n- Add the **Home IdP Discovery** authenticator and move it into the position before the user forms. Configure it to not require a verified domain nor email.\\n- Finally, using the action menu, bind it to the browser flow.\\n\\nGo back to the `debug-app`, and let\u2019s try a login using an email domain that matches the one we configured.\\n- First, run `npm i` and `npm start` to start the debug app, and navigate to http://localhost:3001 in your browser. See that it redirects to the default login.\\n- Enter the email address in the new email only form.\\n- We are redirected to the Azure identity provider we set up.\\n- Log in to Azure, and then we are redirected to back to `debug-app`.\\n- Let\u2019s take a look at the token and see the data that came over from Azure.\\n\\nAs a bonus, let\u2019s map some information about the user\u2019s organization memberships into the token in case we need to do something with that information in our application.\\n- Go back to the Admin UI and navigate to the Client we created.\\n- Select the **frontend-dedicated** client scope.\\n- Add a mapper by configuration.\\n- Select the **Organization Role** mapper and configure it as shown.\\n- Save the configuration.\\n\\nNow let\u2019s go back to the `debug-app` and reload. \\n- Take a look at the token. It now contains information about the organization we created. \\n- The user was automatically created and added as a member to the organization when we logged in through the Azure identity provider. \\n\\nYou now have a fully working authentication and enterprise SSO setup for your application. It took about 5 minutes!"},{"id":"securing-apps-with-keycloak","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/securing-apps-with-keycloak","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-17-securing-apps-with-keycloak.md","title":"Protecting Your Application With Keycloak","description":"There are a lot of guides out there, official and unofficial, for how to secure applications with Keycloak.

The subject is rather broad, so it\'s difficult to know where to start. To begin, we\'ll be focusing on Keycloak\'s use of OpenID Connect (OIDC), and how to use that standard, along with some helpful libraries, to secure a simple but instructive application. \\n\\nFor the purposes of the sample, we\'ll actually be using two common applications, a frontend single-page application (SPA) written in JavaScript, and a backend REST API written for Node.js. The language we selected for the sample is JavaScript, but the principles apply no matter the implementation technology you choose.\\n\\n### What is OIDC?\\n\\nWhen learning about identity and access management technologies, you\'ll be confronted with an alphabet-soup of acronyms to learn. OIDC, or OpenID Connect is one of the most important ones for securing applications, be it browser-based, APIs, mobile or native. Our friend over at OneLogin does a great job of explaining [OIDC in plain english](https://www.onelogin.com/blog/openid-connect-explained-in-plain-english-2) for those that are curious.\\n\\nFor the purpose of this guide, it is sufficient to know that OIDC is an open authentication protocol that works on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. OIDC allows individuals to use single sign-on (SSO) to access relying party sites using OpenID Providers (OPs), such as an email provider or social network, to authenticate their identities. It provides the application or service with information about the user, the context of their authentication, and access to their profile information.\\n\\n### Login flow\\n\\nA \\"flow\\" in OIDC terms is a mechanism of authenticating a user, and obtaning access tokens. The flow we\'ll be using in this guide is called the authorization code flow. Fortunately, the internals of the flow are not necessary to understand, as Keycloak handles the details for you. \\n\\nHowever, it is useful to see what is going on in the login process, so that you understand your user\'s experience.\\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-17-authentication-flow.png)\\n\\n### Setup\\n\\nWe\'ll make an assumption for this guide that you are using a cloud deployment of Phase Two enhanced Keycloak. If you haven\'t already set one up, go over to the [self-service launch announcement](/blog/self-service) for details. You may also use your own Keycloak setup, but that setup is beyond the scope of this article.\\n\\nThe sample applications are available in our [demo repo](https://github.com/p2-inc/debug-app) on Github. Clone that repo to your local machine. You\'ll find the applications in the `frontend` and `backend` directory, and a set of supporting files for configuration and deployment.\\n\\n```\\ngit clone https://github.com/p2-inc/debug-app.git\\ncd debug-app\\n```\\n\\n### Client\\n\\nEvery application that Keycloak protects is considered a **Client**. Log into your Keycloak realm, and click on **Clients** in the left navigation, and click *Create client*. \\n\\n1. Enter `frontend` as the **Client ID** and click *Next*\\n2. In the **Capability config** screen, keep the defaults and click *Save*\\n3. In the **Access settings** screen, enter the following values:\\n    1. `http://localhost:3001/*` for **Valid redirect URIs**\\n\\t2. `+` in **Valid post logout redirect URIs**\\n\\t3. `+` in **Web origins**\\n4. Click *Save*\\n4. In the upper right corner, open the **Action** menu and select **Download adapter config**. Click *Download* and move the file to the `debug-app` repo you cloned under the `frontend` folder.\\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-17-client-setup.png)\\n\\n### Make a user\\n\\nBefore we run the application, we need to create a user to log in. Click on **Users** in the left navigation, and click *Add user*. You only need to give the user a username and click *Create*. Find the **Credentials** tab and click **Set password** to give the user a password.\\n\\n### Running the sample apps\\n\\nOpen two terminal windows and go to the directory of the repo you cloned in both. To start, run the following commands in each terminal:\\n\\nFrontend:\\n```\\ncd frontend/\\nnpm install\\nnpm start\\n```\\nBackend:\\n```\\ncd backend/\\nnpm install\\nKC_REALM=<your-realm-name> KC_URL=<your-keycloak-url> npm start\\n```\\nBe sure to replace the realm name, and the URL of your Keycloak installation (e.g. `https://usw2.auth.ac/auth/`).\\n\\nThis will install the necessary components using npm, and will start the servers for both applications. Note: the applications use ports 3001 and 3002 by default. If you have other applications running on these ports, you may have to temporarily shut them down.\\n\\n### Putting it all together\\n\\nLoad <a href=\\"http://localhost:3001/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://localhost:3001/</a> in your browser. This will load the frontend application, which will be immediately redirected to the Keycloak login page. Log in with the user you created.\\n\\nOnce you log in, you\'ll see your profile, and several menu items. First click to the **Access token** menu item. You\'ll see the information from the parsed access token that was returned by Keycloak. This contains information about the user, but also claims related to the users roles and groups. This is because access tokens are meant to be read and validated by resource servers (i.e. our backend service).\\n\\nNext, click **ID token**. You\'ll see similar information to what we saw in the access token, but limited to a standardized set of information that identifies the authentication state of the user. ID tokens are not meant for calling resource servers, and because of that, don\'t contain claims that are meant to be validated by backend services.\\n\\nClicking **Service** will call the backend service. You\'ll see a message that indicates the frontend called the backend, passing the access token, and was authorized to access a secured service. \\n\\nYou can also try the built-in Keycloak Account Management console by clicking **Account**, which gives the user a simple way to manage their information that is stored in Keycloak. It is not necessary to use this with your applications, as you may choose to build it in to your app. However, it\'s a good tool to have out of the box.\\n\\nFinally, clicking **Logout** will take you back to the login page. This is actually sending you to the frontend\'s initial page, which is redirecting you to the login page as its default behavior.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wi9qipIDi4w\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n### What just happened?\\n\\nThere\'s a lot that goes into implementation of the OIDC flow we used to secure our sample applications. Part of the reason to use Keycloak is the mature implementation and client libraries that make protecting applications in a secure way almost trivial. \\n\\nWe encourage you to look at the source in the sample applications (specifically `frontend/app.js` and `backend/app.js`) and observe how the Keycloak client libraries are used to secure these applications. This will be a good place to start when you are working on securing your own applications.\\n\\n### Your application\\n\\nAnother incredible advantage to using standards like OIDC is that you are not constrained to using Keycloak libraries. Because your applications may not be written in JavaScript also, it\'s easy to use other language OIDC client libraries. We maintain a [list of OIDC libraries](/docs/securing-applications/#libraries), and the [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/) also maintains lists of [certified](https://openid.net/developers/certified/) and [uncertified](https://openid.net/developers/uncertified/) implementations\\n\\nToday you saw how to quickly secure an application using Keycloak, and learned more about the underlying OIDC standards. We look forward to seeing what you build!"},{"id":"set-up-magic-links","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/set-up-magic-links","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links.md","title":"Magic Links Guide, and 5 Minute Setup","description":"Someone who is reading this article is probably very different that the average internet user when it comes to passwords.

Furthermore, they are keenly aware of the weaknesses in their personal \\"attack surface\\", and search for ways to balance convenience with risk.\\n\\nBut you are here because you want to find a way to implement magic links quickly. First, some background.\\n\\n### What are magic links?\\n\\nMagic links are a type of password-less authentication that allow your users to log in to your application following a link that is emailed to them, rather than typing a username and password. Magic links can also be used as a part of a multi-factor authentication (MFA) strategy.\\n\\nIn a magic link flow, the application\'s authentication provider asks users for an email address rather than a password. The authentication provider generates a link with an embedded token, and sends to the user\'s email. There may be some other steps taken by the provider, such as verifying the provided email address matches an existing user. The user then opens the email, clicks the link, is verified by the authentication provider, and is granted access to the application\\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-flow.png)\\n\\n### Pros and cons\\n\\nLike any mechanism that tries to streamline a security process such as authentication, there are both pros and cons to the magic link approach. First in the plus column:\\n\\n- Enhances user experience, which makes users more likely to use your application, and be satisfied with the experience. This drives user engagement.\\n- User onboarding is accelerated, as magic links can be sent to new users as well as existing ones. Registration for your application is as easy as entering your email address.\\n- You\'ll never have a password breach. When there are no passwords, there are no password breaches. A huge number of corporate data breaches are due to insufficient and compromised passwords.\\n- No more customer support requests related to lost passwords. Over half of customer support requests are due to authentication problems, many of those are users unable to remember their passwords. This eliminates a huge portion of those.\\n\\nNothing is perfect, and there are also several potential downsides to magic links:\\n\\n- Account security and access are now tied to the security of the user\'s email account. If the user\'s computer or other device is compromised, and attacker could potentially obtain the link and impersonate the user.\\n- If the user or email provider does not enforce encrypted network access to email, it may be possible for an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack where they can obtain the link by observing network traffic.\\n- Ability to access your application is now tied to email deliverability. If your email service or the user\'s email provider fails to deliver the email containing the link in a timely fashion, it could deteriorate the experience for the user.\\n\\n### Limiting risk\\n\\nFortunately, there are things your application and the user can do in order to limit some of the possible downside risks of using magic links. Your application can:\\n\\n- Make the magic links single use, or set a very short expiration time for the links.\\n- Enforce an additional factor when using magic links.\\n\\nYour user can:\\n\\n- Choose an email provider that enforces the use of encrypted connections.\\n- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to further protect their email accounts.\\n\\n### Setup guide\\n\\nSorry for the wait! We wanted to give you an overview of magic links before diving into how to set them up with Phase Two. \\n\\nIf you haven\'t already, get an account on [Phase Two](https://phasetwo.io/dashboard). You\'ll notice that we use magic links in addition to social login options. As we said above, we\'re trying to make it as frictionless as possible to get in and start using the product.\\n\\nOnce you log in and create your first deployment, open the Phase Two enhanced Keycloak console. In order to email links to your users, you\'ll need to set up email. If you haven\'t already done that, head over to our [email setup guide](/blog/2022-10-05-set-up-email.md). \\n\\nAfter you\'ve completed email setup, select the **Authentication** menu item, and then select the **Magic link** flow from the list.\\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-magiclinkauth.png)\\n\\nOpen the configuration for the **Magic Link Authenticator** by clicking the gear icon on the last line with the **Magic Link** execution. You\'ll notice two options:\\n- **Force create user** creates a new user when an email is provided that does not match an existing user. This allows the use of magic links to register new users that have not been previously seen.\\n- **Update profile on create** adds an UPDATE_PROFILE required action if the user was created. This means that the user will need to fill out other required fields such as first/last name, etc. \\n\\nFor the purpose of our demonstration, let\'s set **Force create user** to ON and **Update profile on create** to OFF (remember, low friction). Save the configuration, and go back to the flow page.\\n\\nIn the **Action** menu of the flow page, select **Bind**, and select **Browser flow**.\\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-bind.png)\\n\\nNow you\'re ready to test it out. If you don\'t have an application that is setup and protected by Keycloak, you can use the built-in account console to try it out. Navigate to the **Clients** menu, and open the link next to the **account** client in an incognito window (this will prevent conflict, as you are already logged in to the admin console as the administrator). \\n\\nClick **Sign In** and you\'ll be redirected to the authentication page. Enter your email address, and you\'ll be sent a magic link. Click on the link in your email, and you\'ll see your details in the account console. \\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-login.png)\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-confirm.png)\\n\\nGo back to the admin console in the other browser window, and navigate to the **Users** section. You will be able to find the user that was just created.\\n\\n![](/blog/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-admin-user.png)\\n\\nMagic links are a great way to streamline your user onboarding and experience to help you easily drive engagement across your application. Phase Two makes it quick and easy to integrate magic links (and social login, and enterprise SSO, and much more). Stay tuned for more guides that will help you build the authentication experience that is right for your app."},{"id":"set-up-email","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/set-up-email","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-05-set-up-email.md","title":"Set Up Email in Phase Two","description":"One of the first things you will need to do when getting a Keycloak Realm ready for use is to set up your email server configuration.

Free realms are limited to fewer than 1000 users and 5 SSO connections. Otherwise, there are no restrictions beyond abiding by our [terms of use](/docs/terms). Sound good?

The message was consistent. SSO was a key barrier to unlocking enterprise customers, and we had made it much easier to quickly integrate the alphabet-soup of enterprise identity providers.\\n\\nFurthermore, many of our customers have responded well to our \\"one price per project\\" idea, citing that competitors and other enterprise authentication companies had pricing models that ramped on a per-user and per-SSO connection basis, making them economically unattractive to companies with business and pricing models that couldn\'t support that. \\n\\nOne of the other points that we heard loud and clear from our first customers, was the fear of vendor lock-in. Integrating tools like this can be a large effort, and can be difficult to unwind if the terms or service fall short. While our adoption of standards such as OpenID and SAML allayed some of those fears, we wanted to go a step further.\\n\\nWe built the initial verison of Phase Two as a set of extensions to the [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) Open Source Identity and Access Management system, built and maintained by Red Hat. After several months of developing for it, and operating it for our customers, we\'ve decided to continue using it. Keycloak has been battle-tested and hardened for over 6 years. It\'s security and reliability is depended on by organizations from small startups to Fortune 500 companies and governments.\\n\\nTo put to rest any future concerns about vendor lock-in, we\'re committing to making our core extensions to Keycloak open source. While we will endeavor to make Phase Two simple to use, operate and scale, we will maintain compatibility so that customers can migrate to their own Keycloak deployment. Updates and links to our open source extensions will be published in the [Open Source](/docs/introduction/open-source) section of the documentation, and will be available in our [p2-inc GitHub organization page](https://github.com/p2-inc).\\n\\nWe have benefitted immensely from the open source communitiy, and we are excited to give back!"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2020-09-28-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to Phase Two","description":"After building and working for startups and technology companies for almost 25 years, I found myself having a sense of d\xe9j\xe0-vu.","date":"2020-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 28, 2020","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"phase_two","permalink":"/blog/tags/phase-two"}],"readingTime":2.1,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Phase Two"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome to Phase Two","author":"Phase Two","tags":["release","phase_two"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Keycloak, and Our Commitment to Open Source","permalink":"/blog/keycloak"}},"content":"After building and working for startups and technology companies for almost 25 years, I found myself having a sense of d\xe9j\xe0-vu. \\n\\nHad I really built the same features and functionality over and over?\\n\\nEveryone of us who has been in the industry for any length of time probably has the same feeling. Whether or not we are fully conscious of it, we probably built a (bad) version of login, registration, user management, authorization, organizations and invitations, audit logging, etc. at least one time for every company we\'ve worked for. \\n\\nIn early 2018, I joined an enterprise SaaS startup, where I built the initial team and product over 18 months. Analyzing tickets and epics in the project tracking system we used, I found that over 60% of our first 18 months was spent building features and functionality like this -- essential building blocks, but not the core competency we sought to test in the marketplace. And the result of that effort was only adequate versions of those common features, which resulted in less time spent on what we were trying to prove. I began to refer to this heavy tax a \\"SaaS CRUD\\".\\n\\nWas this really what everyone else was doing? I was lucky to have a large network of engineering leaders at companies that ranged from the earliest stages to the largest public companies, so I asked them. The responses were remarkably consisitent. Early stage companies wished there was something comprehensive they could adopt, and later stage and large companies lamented not adopting external tools earlier that gave them guarantees around uptime and compliance. All were aware of or had tried to knit together a mish-mash of \\"feature company\\" products, and all expressed dissatisfaction with \\"model mismatch\\" of most of the tools in the marketplace, which demanded more integration overhead than the perceived benefit allowed. \\n\\nI was lucky to find others that had observed the same thing. We joined forces and spent the next 6 months interviewing companies of a range of sizes, developing a playbook for companies building new products. Based on that playbook, today we are releasing our first version of tooling designed to help application developers avoid rebuilding \\"SaaS CRUD\\".\\n\\nPhase Two is designed to help SaaS companies accelerate time-to-market. Authentication and SSO are our first targets, but we plan to expand to many other areas of pain for the growing company seeking enterprise adoption. We\'d love for you to join us on this journey.
