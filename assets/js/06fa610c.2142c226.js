I was lucky to have a large network of engineering leaders at companies that ranged from the earliest stages to the largest public companies, so I asked them.

Early stage companies wished there was something comprehensive they could adopt, and later stage and large companies lamented not adopting external tools earlier that gave them guarantees around uptime and compliance.
