We\'ve received a lot of requests from customers to implement \\"magic link\\" login functionality that would allow users to login to an application using a link sent to their email or over some other secure channel. \\n\\nTo that end, we\'ve implemented two pathways for creating a magic link. One can be configured in the Authentication section of the admin UI by duplicating the Browser flow, and replacing the normal Username/Password/OTP forms with the Magic Link execution type\\n![Install Magic Link Authenticator in Browser Flow](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-magic-link/raw/main/docs/assets/magic-authenticator.png)\\nThis mechanism inserts a authenticator in the login flow that intercepts the email address and sends the magic link in an email to to the user.\\n\\nWe\'ve also implemented a web service that allows you to create a magic link without necessarily sending an email. This will allow you to send the link through another channel. Specification for the new endpoint can be found in the [Magic Link API Documentation](/api/create-a-magic-link-to-log-in-a-user).\\n\\nBoth methods have the option of forcing the creation of a new user when an unknown email address is used. This allows a combination login/registration flow that combines an email verification. We think this really nails reducing friction in a new user flow.\\n\\nWe\'re open sourcing the Keycloak extensionsso that the broad Keycloak community can benefit right away.

The message was consistent. SSO was a key barrier to unlocking enterprise customers, and we had made it much easier to quickly integrate the alphabet-soup of enterprise identity providers.\\n\\nFurthermore, many of our customers have responded well to our \\"one price per project\\" idea, citing that competitors and other enterprise authentication companies had pricing models that ramped on a per-user and per-SSO connection basis, making them economically unattractive to companies with business and pricing models that couldn\'t support that. \\n\\nOne of the other points that we heard loud and clear from our first customers, was the fear of vendor lock-in. Integrating tools like this can be a large effort, and can be difficult to unwind if the terms or service fall short. While our adoption of standards such as OpenID and SAML allayed some of those fears, we wanted to go a step further.\\n\\nWe built the initial verison of Phase Two as a set of extensions to the [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) Open Source Identity and Access Management system, built and maintained by Red Hat. After several months of developing for it, and operating it for our customers, we\'ve decided to continue using it. Keycloak has been battle-tested and hardened for over 6 years. It\'s security and reliability is depended on by organizations from small startups to Fortune 500 companies and governments.\\n\\nTo put to rest any future concerns about vendor lock-in, we\'re committing to making our core extensions to Keycloak open source. While we will endeavor to make Phase Two simple to use, operate and scale, we will maintain compatibility so that customers can migrate to their own Keycloak deployment. Updates and links to our open source extensions will be published in the [Open Source](/docs/introduction/open-source) section of the documentation, and will be available in our [p2-inc GitHub organization page](https://github.com/p2-inc).\\n\\nWe have benefitted immensely from the open source communitiy, and we are excited to give back!"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2020-09-28-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to Phase Two","description":"After building and working for startups and technology companies for almost 25 years, I found myself having a sense of d\xe9j\xe0-vu.","date":"2020-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 28, 2020","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"phase_two","permalink":"/blog/tags/phase-two"}],"readingTime":2.1,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Phase Two"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome to Phase Two","author":"Phase Two","tags":["release","phase_two"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Keycloak, and Our Commitment to Open Source","permalink":"/blog/keycloak"}},"content":"After building and working for startups and technology companies for almost 25 years, I found myself having a sense of d\xe9j\xe0-vu. \\n\\nHad I really built the same features and functionality over and over?\\n\\nEveryone of us who has been in the industry for any length of time probably has the same feeling. Whether or not we are fully conscious of it, we probably built a (bad) version of login, registration, user management, authorization, organizations and invitations, audit logging, etc. at least one time for every company we\'ve worked for. \\n\\nIn early 2018, I joined an enterprise SaaS startup, where I built the initial team and product over 18 months. Analyzing tickets and epics in the project tracking system we used, I found that over 60% of our first 18 months was spent building features and functionality like this -- essential building blocks, but not the core competency we sought to test in the marketplace. And the result of that effort was only adequate versions of those common features, which resulted in less time spent on what we were trying to prove. I began to refer to this heavy tax a \\"SaaS CRUD\\".\\n\\nWas this really what everyone else was doing? I was lucky to have a large network of engineering leaders at companies that ranged from the earliest stages to the largest public companies, so I asked them. The responses were remarkably consisitent. Early stage companies wished there was something comprehensive they could adopt, and later stage and large companies lamented not adopting external tools earlier that gave them guarantees around uptime and compliance. All were aware of or had tried to knit together a mish-mash of \\"feature company\\" products, and all expressed dissatisfaction with \\"model mismatch\\" of most of the tools in the marketplace, which demanded more integration overhead than the perceived benefit allowed. \\n\\nI was lucky to find others that had observed the same thing. We joined forces and spent the next 6 months interviewing companies of a range of sizes, developing a playbook for companies building new products. Based on that playbook, today we are releasing our first version of tooling designed to help application developers avoid rebuilding \\"SaaS CRUD\\".\\n\\nPhase Two is designed to help SaaS companies accelerate time-to-market. Authentication and SSO are our first targets, but we plan to expand to many other areas of pain for the growing company seeking enterprise adoption. We\'d love for you to join us on this journey.
