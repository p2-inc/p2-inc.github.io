        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Someone who is reading this article is probably very different that the average internet user when it comes to passwords. Developers and IT admins, either because of security savvy or compliance, use password managers, multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms, or prefer sites that offer password-less authentication. Furthermore, they are keenly aware of the weaknesses in their personal "attack surface", and search for ways to balance convenience with risk.</p><p>But you are here because you want to find a way to implement magic links quickly. First, some background.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-magic-links">What are magic links?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-magic-links" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Magic links are a type of password-less authentication that allow your users to log in to your application following a link that is emailed to them, rather than typing a username and password. Magic links can also be used as a part of a multi-factor authentication (MFA) strategy.</p><p>In a magic link flow, the application's authentication provider asks users for an email address rather than a password. The authentication provider generates a link with an embedded token, and sends to the user's email. There may be some other steps taken by the provider, such as verifying the provided email address matches an existing user. The user then opens the email, clicks the link, is verified by the authentication provider, and is granted access to the application</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-flow-b4ec250b3b1faa0bcfe403ca9ca0a7d8.png" width="768" height="466" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pros-and-cons">Pros and cons<a class="hash-link" href="#pros-and-cons" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Like any mechanism that tries to streamline a security process such as authentication, there are both pros and cons to the magic link approach. First in the plus column:</p><ul><li>Enhances user experience, which makes users more likely to use your application, and be satisfied with the experience. This drives user engagement.</li><li>User onboarding is accelerated, as magic links can be sent to new users as well as existing ones. Registration for your application is as easy as entering your email address.</li><li>You'll never have a password breach. When there are no passwords, there are no password breaches. A huge number of corporate data breaches are due to insufficient and compromised passwords.</li><li>No more customer support requests related to lost passwords. Over half of customer support requests are due to authentication problems, many of those are users unable to remember their passwords. This eliminates a huge portion of those.</li></ul><p>Nothing is perfect, and there are also several potential downsides to magic links:</p><ul><li>Account security and access are now tied to the security of the user's email account. If the user's computer or other device is compromised, and attacker could potentially obtain the link and impersonate the user.</li><li>If the user or email provider does not enforce encrypted network access to email, it may be possible for an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack where they can obtain the link by observing network traffic.</li><li>Ability to access your application is now tied to email deliverability. If your email service or the user's email provider fails to deliver the email containing the link in a timely fashion, it could deteriorate the experience for the user.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="limiting-risk">Limiting risk<a class="hash-link" href="#limiting-risk" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Fortunately, there are things your application and the user can do in order to limit some of the possible downside risks of using magic links. Your application can:</p><ul><li>Make the magic links single use, or set a very short expiration time for the links.</li><li>Enforce an additional factor when using magic links.</li></ul><p>Your user can:</p><ul><li>Choose an email provider that enforces the use of encrypted connections.</li><li>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to further protect their email accounts.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="setup-guide">Setup guide<a class="hash-link" href="#setup-guide" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Sorry for the wait! We wanted to give you an overview of magic links before diving into how to set them up with Phase Two. </p><p>If you haven't already, get an account on <a href="https://phasetwo.io/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase Two</a>. You'll notice that we use magic links in addition to social login options. As we said above, we're trying to make it as frictionless as possible to get in and start using the product.</p><p>Once you log in and create your first deployment, open the Phase Two enhanced Keycloak console. In order to email links to your users, you'll need to set up email. If you haven't already done that, head over to our <a href="/blog/set-up-email">email setup guide</a>. </p><p>After you've completed email setup, select the <strong>Authentication</strong> menu item, and then select the <strong>Magic link</strong> flow from the list.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-magiclinkauth-e40ff40256c02d0f4280f41e7594016c.png" width="1427" height="816" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Open the configuration for the <strong>Magic Link Authenticator</strong> by clicking the gear icon on the last line with the <strong>Magic Link</strong> execution. You'll notice two options:</p><ul><li><strong>Force create user</strong> creates a new user when an email is provided that does not match an existing user. This allows the use of magic links to register new users that have not been previously seen.</li><li><strong>Update profile on create</strong> adds an UPDATE_PROFILE required action if the user was created. This means that the user will need to fill out other required fields such as first/last name, etc. </li></ul><p>For the purpose of our demonstration, let's set <strong>Force create user</strong> to ON and <strong>Update profile on create</strong> to OFF (remember, low friction). Save the configuration, and go back to the flow page.</p><p>In the <strong>Action</strong> menu of the flow page, select <strong>Bind</strong>, and select <strong>Browser flow</strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-bind-160640f1880ba16e2771180440b26c73.png" width="1136" height="198" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now you're ready to test it out. If you don't have an application that is setup and protected by Keycloak, you can use the built-in account console to try it out. Navigate to the <strong>Clients</strong> menu, and open the link next to the <strong>account</strong> client in an incognito window (this will prevent conflict, as you are already logged in to the admin console as the administrator). </p><p>Click <strong>Sign In</strong> and you'll be redirected to the authentication page. Enter your email address, and you'll be sent a magic link. Click on the link in your email, and you'll see your details in the account console. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-login-8e1477c5b0ce012da2fcd791e3dad4f7.png" width="530" height="376" class="img_ev3q">

You will be able to find the user that was just created.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2022-10-12-set-up-magic-links-admin-user-4355a7cb65d28f64cdd1ba146855c63b.png" width="1145" height="368" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Magic links are a great way to streamline your user onboarding and experience to help you easily drive engagement across your application. Phase Two makes it quick and easy to integrate magic links (and social login, and enterprise SSO, and much more). Stay tuned for more guides that will help you build the authentication experience that is right for your app.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the first things you will need to do when getting a Keycloak Realm ready for use is to set up your email server configuration. There are many system emails that are sent to users in the course of verifying and updating user accounts: Email address verification, magic links, password reset, account update, login failure notifications, identity provider linking, etc.</p><p>In order to provide your users with a positive experience, these messages need a way to get to them. Keycloak supports any internet reachable SMTP server. If you are currently testing, and don't have an email server or service that you currently use, <a href="https://sendgrid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SendGrid</a> provides free accounts that allow you to send up to 100 emails per day forever. For debugging, you can also use a service like <a href="https://mailtrap.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MailTrap</a> to give you a catch-all for emails coming from Keycloak.</p><p>If you are using a Phase Two Deployment, log in to the self-service dashboard, and click on the <strong>Open Console</strong> link for the Deployment you wish to use. Once in the Keycloak admin console, click <strong>Realm settings</strong> in the left menu, and then click the <strong>Email</strong> tab.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2022-10-05-set-up-email-template-257d63b3adb88ec2ef3a86e1b3945b00.png" width="1065" height="407" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the first section, labeled <strong>Template</strong>, you will set options that will be used in the templates for the emails that are sent to your users. The only required field is the <strong>From</strong> field, which must contain the email address the user will see the email originating from. This should be an email address that your email server is expecting, and it will not block for authorization reasons.</p><p>The other fields in the <strong>Template</strong> section are not required, but will enhance how your emails look:</p><ul><li><strong>From</strong> address used to send emails (required)</li><li><strong>From display name</strong> a user-friendly name displayed along <strong>From</strong></li><li><strong>Reply to</strong> an email address that will be used by email clients when your user replies to an email</li><li><strong>Reply to display name</strong> a user-friendly name displayed along <strong>Reply to</strong></li><li><strong>Envelope from</strong> Bounce Address used for the mails that are rejected</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy"

section, you will provide details of your SMTP server:</p><ul><li><strong>Host</strong> indicates the SMTP server hostname used for sending emails</li><li><strong>Port</strong> indicates the SMTP server port (usually 25, 465, 587, or 2525)</li><li><strong>Encryption</strong> support encryption for communication with your SMTP server</li><li><strong>Authentication</strong> if your SMTP server

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been pretty quiet over the summer. Since we released the <a href="https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-orgs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Organizations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-magic-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic Link</a> extensions and open sourced them, there has been a lot of interest in using Phase Two.</p><p>We were flattered by the inbound interest, but our small team wasn't able to keep up with demand for trial accounts. Rather than scramble against that demand, we opted to pause new accounts, and instead build a self-service tool to allow anyone to quickly provision a new deployment a try it out.</p><p>Today we're announcing the beta launch of the Phase Two Self-service deployment tool. This tool allows you to easily create new deployments of the Phase Two enhanced version of Keycloak in our secure, highly-available clusters. In the future, it will also allow you to deploy dedicated instances that use your own database.</p><p>Take a look at how easy it is to get started:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zzJPmwrEHmU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><p>The clusters that run our deployments are available in two regions (AWS, us-west-2 and eu-central-1), and are backed by <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CockroachDB</a>, giving you scale, resilience and low-latency performance. In the future, clusters and dedicated instances will be available in other regions based on demand.</p><p>We hope you find this new tool valuable, and we look forward to feedback and participation from both our customers and the wider Keycloak community.</p><p><a href="https://phasetwo.io/dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRY IT NOW!</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we're making two announcements: A new, highly-requested feature, and the open sourcing of the extension at the same time. We've received a lot of requests from customers to implement "magic link" login functionality that would allow users to login to an application using a link sent to their email or over some other secure channel. </p><p>To that end, we've implemented two pathways for creating a magic link. One can be configured in the Authentication section of the admin UI by duplicating the Browser flow, and replacing the normal Username/Password/OTP forms with the Magic Link execution type
<img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-magic-link/raw/main/docs/assets/magic-authenticator.png" alt="Install Magic Link Authenticator in Browser Flow" class="img_ev3q">
This mechanism inserts a authenticator in the login flow that intercepts the email address and sends the magic link in an email to to the user.</p><p>We've also implemented a web service that allows you to create a magic link without necessarily sending an email. This will allow you to send the link through another channel. Specification for the new endpoint can be found in the <a href="/api/create-a-magic-link-to-log-in-a-user">Magic Link API Documentation</a>.</p><p>Both methods have the option of forcing the creation of a new user when an unknown email address is used. This allows a combination login/registration flow that combines an email verification. We think this really nails reducing friction in a new user flow.</p><p>We're open sourcing the Keycloak extensionsso that the broad Keycloak community can benefit right away. We are doing this in line with our committment to keeping our core extensions <a href="/docs/introduction/open-source">open source</a>. We hope you find these extensions valuable, and we look forward to feedback and participation from both our customers and the wider Keycloak community. </p><p>The extension is available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-magic-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-magic-link</a></p>]]></content>

While our configuration interface attempts to cover all possible options, and document clearly what each option means, it can still be entirely unclear what is required during a setup.</p><p>Furthermore, the identity provider that is being integrated can present a similarly extensive interface that may not use the same terms and language. However, after investigation into the most common identity providers, we found that most of the configuration options can simply be set by convention if the vendor is known.</p><p>Based on that observation, we've built what we call a "wizard" UI on top of our identity provider configuration to make it easy to integration the top commercial identity provider vendors.

Even though the software is mature, open source, and has a helpfu user community, just spinning up an environment and trying it out can be puzzling for first-time users. It's pretty clear that a lot of people just give up, because they can't get a server running, let alone configure their first realm<sup id="fnref-1-184b95"><a href="#fn-1-184b95" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Because of that, we've decided to offer developers a <em>FREE</em> realm in Phase Two, so those that are interested in trying it out can get successful quickly. Free realms are limited to fewer than 1000 users and 5 SSO connections. Otherwise, there are no restrictions beyond abiding by our <a href="/docs/terms">terms of use</a>. Sound good? Please fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIwakLlJpd9OS3r1fCsPDX01Y9BTSvxf5Ceru_FrpAQE5hIA/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact form</a> with your company information, and we'll respond with access information for your realm. </p><div class="footnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn-1-184b95">In Keycloak, a "realm" manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following the initial release of Phase Two's authentication and SSO tools 3 months ago, we had a warm reception by several early- to mid- stage SaaS companies. The message was consistent. SSO was a key barrier to unlocking enterprise customers, and we had made it much easier to quickly integrate the alphabet-soup of enterprise identity providers.</p><p>Furthermore, many of our customers have responded well to our "one price per project" idea, citing that competitors and other enterprise authentication companies had pricing models that ramped on a per-user and per-SSO connection basis, making them economically unattractive to companies with business and pricing models that couldn't support that. </p><p>One of the other points that we heard loud and clear from our first customers, was the fear of vendor lock-in. Integrating tools like this can be a large effort, and can be difficult to unwind if the terms or service fall short. While our adoption of standards such as OpenID and SAML allayed some of those fears, we wanted to go a step further.</p><p>We built the initial verison of Phase Two as a set of extensions to the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keycloak</a> Open Source Identity and Access Management system, built and maintained by Red Hat. After several months of developing for it, and operating it for our customers, we've decided to continue using it. Keycloak has been battle-tested and hardened for over 6 years. It's security and reliability is depended on by organizations from small startups to Fortune 500 companies and governments.</p><p>To put to rest any future concerns about vendor lock-in, we're committing to making our core extensions to Keycloak open source. While we will endeavor to make Phase Two simple to use, operate and scale, we will maintain compatibility so that customers can migrate to their own Keycloak deployment. Updates and links to our open source extensions will be published in the <a href="/docs/introduction/open-source">Open Source</a> section of the documentation, and will be available in our <a href="https://github.com/p2-inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p2-inc GitHub organization page</a>.</p><p>We have benefitted immensely from the open source communitiy, and we are excited to give back!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After building and working for startups and technology companies for almost 25 years, I found myself having a sense of déjà-vu. </p><p>Had I really built the same features and functionality over and over?</p><p>Everyone of us who has been in the industry for any length of time probably has the same feeling. Whether or not we are fully conscious of it, we probably built a (bad) version of login, registration, user management, authorization, organizations and invitations, audit logging, etc. at least one time for every company we've worked for. </p><p>In early 2018, I joined an enterprise SaaS startup, where I built the initial team and product over 18 months. Analyzing tickets and epics in the project tracking system we used, I found that over 60% of our first 18 months was spent building features and functionality like this -- essential building blocks, but not the core competency we sought to test in the marketplace. And the result of that effort was only adequate versions of those common features, which resulted in less time spent on what we were trying to prove. I began to refer to this heavy tax a "SaaS CRUD".</p><p>Was this really what everyone else was doing? I was lucky to have a large network of engineering leaders at companies that ranged from the earliest stages to the largest public companies, so I asked them. The responses were remarkably consisitent. Early stage companies wished there was something comprehensive they could adopt, and later stage and large companies lamented not adopting external tools earlier that gave them guarantees around uptime and compliance. All were aware of or had tried to knit together a mish-mash of "feature company" products, and all expressed dissatisfaction with "model mismatch" of most of the tools in the marketplace, which demanded more integration overhead than the perceived benefit allowed. </p><p>I was lucky to find others that had observed the same thing. We joined forces and spent the next 6 months interviewing companies of a range of sizes, developing a playbook for companies building new products. Based on that playbook, today we are releasing our first version of tooling designed to help application developers avoid rebuilding "SaaS CRUD".</p><p>Phase Two is designed to help SaaS companies accelerate time-to-market. Authentication and SSO are our first targets, but we plan to expand to many other areas of pain for the growing company seeking enterprise adoption. We'd love for you to join us on this journey.
